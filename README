ColorCipher

ColorCipher is a version of the popular game MasterMind for the iPhone

I originally made ColorCipher in 2008 and released it for $1 on the app store.

At this point I think it's served it's time, and so i've made it free and am giving away
the source.  Hope someone can find it educational/useful
