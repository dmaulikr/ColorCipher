				If you've ever played MasterMind or Bulls &amp; Cows, ColorCipher will be quite familiar.
				The goal of the game is to guess the sequence of colors hidden at the top of the board.
				To start, drag the color wheels up and down to make a guess. You can touch any where on the column to change the color.
				Double touch OK and you will see a clue
				circle appear and the next row ready for another guess. In the clue circle, each red slice means 
				right color right spot and each white slice means right color wrong spot.  Use the clues to help make
				a better guess each time. If you can guess the solution before running out of rows
				you win!
