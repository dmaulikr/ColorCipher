				In the images below, the top row is the hidden
				solution and the bottom row the player's guess.  The clue can be found on the right of the guess.
			</p>
			<div class="exampleBlock">
				<strong>example 1:</strong>
				<img src="example1.png"/>
				Here only the guess and the solution share one thing in common: the blue column.  Therefore the
				clue contains just one red slice.
			</div>
			<div class="exampleBlock">	
				<strong>example 2:</strong>
				<img src="example2.png"/>
				This one is a lot like the example above, but the white column in the guess being out of 
				alignment with the white in the solution adds a white slice to the clue. It's the right color, but the wrong spot.			
			</div>
			<div class="exampleBlock">			
				<strong>example 3:</strong>
				<img src="example3.png"/>
				Duplicates get tricky! Decoding them is the secret to successful play.  In this example's clue
				the red slice is present because of the blue to blue match. However there is just one white slice even 
				though the solution contains two greens.  This is because each peg in the guess and the solution can only be
				paired once.
			</div>
			<div class="exampleBlock">
				<strong>example 4:</strong>
				<img src="example4.png"/>
				Another tricky example involving duplicates. This example is the reverse above, 
				where two blues in the wrong spots only receive one white slice in the clue.  This is because the 
				solution only contains one blue.
			</div>
			<div class="exampleBlock">
				<strong>example 5:</strong>
				<img src="example5.png"/>
				An example to show some complexity.  The clue contains two red slices because two of the greens are the right color, right spot.
				A white slice to represent the white in the wrong spot. The third green that is in the wrong spot does not get a white slice because the other two
				greens are already evaluated by the red slices.			
			</div>
			<div class="exampleBlock">
				<strong>example 6:</strong>
				<img src="example6.png"/>
				The final goal! Guessing the solution exactly You will see 4 red slices and the solution
				revealed.
